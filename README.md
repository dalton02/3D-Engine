## 3D Game Engine (3DMOTOR2)

This project is a 3D game engine created from scratch using C++ and the SDL2 library. Unlike many other engines, it does not rely on OpenGL or other 3D libraries. The primary goal of this project is for educational purposes, specifically to gain a deeper understanding of matrix and vector manipulation for rendering and transforming 3D objects on the computer screen.

### Getting Started

To experience the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the '3DMOTOR2.exe'.
3. If you like to see the code, just head to the 'src' folder.

### Acknowledgments

Special thanks to [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) for providing the foundation for this project.
